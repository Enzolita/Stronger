# Stronger
### For this project I've created a website for a gym called Stronger that's based in Stockholm Sweden.
### This website is created mainly for people who want to make a change their lifestyle and for those who love fitness and to join a community with people who share the same interest.
### The target audience for this website will be people looking to get into fitness or are currently already working out.
